  * Revert the parts of the CVS sync in 0.97-8 that introduced the GNU FDL,
    restoring the version of the documentation from the 0.97 release that
    was under a simple permissive licence; this undoes a few minor textual
    fixes, but avoids problems with Front-Cover and Back-Cover Texts without
    having to create a separate grub-legacy-doc package in non-free (closes:
    #708946).
  * Build with -fno-combine-stack-adjustments, since that optimisation pass
    confuses the stack games played by GRUB itself (closes: #768135).
