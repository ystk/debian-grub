grub (0.97-44) unstable; urgency=low

  Versions of the kernel Linux newer than 2.6.23, like the ones included in
  Debian Lenny, are known to differ slightly in their binary format, in a way
  that very old versions of GRUB are unable to boot.

  If you're upgrading GRUB in a system that was installed before Debian Etch,
  and you have never manually updated your GRUB install, it is possible that
  your system stops booting.

  In order to prevent that, it is recommended that you install the latest GRUB
  by issuing (as root) the following command after upgrading the grub package:

    grub-install "(hd0)"

  (assuming hd0 is mapped in /boot/grub/device.map to the disk used by your
  BIOS to boot;  in a multi-disk environment you might need to use a different
  parameter)

  Note: even if your setup is not affected by this problem, it is always a
  good idea to keep your GRUB install up-to-date, so if in doubt it's best
  that you update it anyway.

grub (0.97-16) unstable; urgency=low

  grub-install and update-grub has changed location.
  
  There's a wrapper available in /sbin to keep backward compatibility but
  it'll be removed once Etch is release as stable. You _must_ edit your
  /etc/kernel-img.conf and change the paths to /usr/sbin/update-grub. 
  For example:

  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = /sbin/update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = /sbin/update-grub
  `----

  Should be change to:
  
  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = update-grub
  `----
